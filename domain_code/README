Chris,

1) Please proofread the writeup as well as make any edits you feel fit.
2) The print order is:
- Writeup
- Main.cs			(This is the simple RNG program which writes to the csv) 
- FauxBiasedRNGOutput		(This is the output of the simple RNG program which writes to a csv)
- dataset_partioner.py		(This is the dataset partioner which can extract the big dataset and reduce it)
- DBN.py			(This is the main file DBN is run from)
- RBM.py			(This is the restricted boltzman machine portion of the code)
- mlp.py			(This is where I inject biased weights into the hidden layers)
- 
NOTE: I included just DBN, mlp, and rbm (only 2 of which I have modified). These are to show him what some of the code looks like which we will be integrating. 

3) Can you print these AND turn them in? I do not think (again) I want to make it out to class because I am SOOO behind on the work.
